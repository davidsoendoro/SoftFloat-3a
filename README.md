Berkeley SoftFloat is a software implementation of binary floating-point that
conforms to the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic.
SoftFloat is distributed in the form of C source code.
Building the SoftFloat sources generates a library file (typically
`softfloat.a` or `libsoftfloat.a`) containing the
floating-point subroutines.


The SoftFloat package is documented in the following files in the
`doc` subdirectory:

* The SoftFloat functions:
http:doc/SoftFloat.html.
* Building SoftFloat:
Http:doc/SoftFloat-source.html
* History of the major changes:
http:doc/SoftFloat-history.html

Other files in the package comprise the source code for SoftFloat.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

SoftFloat 3a For Hercules (S3FH) is built from source using the 
following process:

- Clone SoftFloat 3a For Hercules into a directory tree.
- Configure the build using CMake.
- Compile sources into a build directory.
- Install the build library, public headers, and license files  into 
  an installation directory.
- Configure the Hercules Hyperion build to find S3FH in the
  installation directory.  (Documented in the Hyperion 
  build instructions)

If you use the recommended directory structure, described below, 
you can skip step 4.  

PREREQUISITE SOFTWARE - UNIX

- CMake version 3.2 or better
- A git command-line tool.  
- A c compiler at a level sufficient to build Hyperion.  

Note 1.  Git is not required if, instead of cloning SoftFloat 3a For
         Hercules, you download the .zip file offered by github.com.
         If you plan to develop, use Git.
Note 2.  Github.com offers a zip file, not a tar.gz, even when you 
         access the site from a browser on a UNIX graphical desktop.  
         So, although UNIX trades in tar.gz, github.com has not 
         received the memo.  If the ark command on your UNIX does 
         not handle .zip files, 7zip can be used.  


PREREQUISITE SOFTWARE - Windows

- CMake version 3.2 or better
- Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.
- A Windows SDK compatible with the target Windows version.
- Posh-git command line github client.  

Note 1.  Earlier versions of Visual Studio may be used and should 
         work, but they have not been tested by this author.  
Note 2.  Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition has no license fee when
         used by individual developers or for qualifying open-source
         licensed software (OSI-verified).
Note 3.  Posh-git is installed as part of the Github for Windows
         GUI client, available at https://desktop.github.com/.  It
         can also be installed stand-alone from its own git repository,
         at https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git.  
Note 4.  Posh-git is not required if you are only building; you can
         download the zip file from github.com.  If you are developing,
         use Posh-git.  

(I believe Posh-git is so named because it uses Windows Power Shell, 
not because it is particularly rich or luxurious.)


RECOMMENDED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

The parent directory of the build and install directories, "x86" in 
the example below, enables multiple target systems for builds.

It should be at the same level as the Hyperion source directory, and
while it may be anything you wish, the following defaults are 
recommended.

- On Windows, use the value of the %PROCESSOR-ARCHITECTURE% environment
  variable to avoid the need for step 4. above.  
- On UNIX, use the value returned by uname -p.

hercules/hyperion/             # Hyperion source (see Note 1.)
        /SoftFloat-3a          # SoftFloat 3a For Hercules source
        /x86/hyperion/         # Hyperion build/install directory
        /x86/s3fh              # S3FH install dir
                               # ..includes copyright notices
        /x86/s3fh/lib          # contains S3FH s3fhFloat.lib
        /x86/s3fh/include      # contains S3FH public headers
        /x86/s3fh.release      # S3FH Release build dir
        /x86/s3fh.debug        # S3FH Debug build dir

Note 1.  When building Hyperion under Windows, the source directory is 
also the build directory and may also be the install directory.  


PREPARE TO BUILD FROM SOURCE - Windows

1) Open a "VS2015 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt" from the Windows 
   Start menu.  Use this command prompt for the remaining steps.
   
2) Determine the processor architecture

    echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%
    
3) Build the recommended directory tree.  Substitute the value of 
   %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% for "x86" in the directory names below.  

    mkdir hercules\hyperion
    mkdir hercules\SoftFloat-3a
    mkdir hercules\x86\hyperion
    mkdir hercules\x86\s3fh
    mkdir hercules\x86\s3fh.release
    mkdir hercules\x86\s3fh.debug

The remaining directories are built by CMake.


PREPARE TO BUILD FROM SOURCE - UNIX

1) Open terminal or console prompt.  You can perform this procedure
   an SSH connection to the UNIX system used for the build.  Use this
   command prompt for the remaining steps.  
   
2) Determine the processor architecture

    uname -p
    
3) Build the recommended directory tree.  Substitute the result 
   returned from uname -p for "amd64" in the directory names below.  

    mkdir hercules/hyperion
    mkdir hercules/SoftFloat-3a
    mkdir hercules/amd64/hyperion
    mkdir hercules/amd64/s3fh
    mkdir hercules/amd64/s3fh.release
    mkdir hercules/amd64/s3fh.debug

The remaining directories are built by CMake.  You may omit s3fh if you
do not plan a debug build.  For day-to-day use, a release build is fine.  


PERFORM THE RELEASE BUILD FROM SOURCE

The same commands are used to perform the build in Windows and in UNIX.
CMake will translate the forward slashes in its command line to the 
orientation required by the host operating system.   

1) Change to the top level in the directory structure

    cd hercules

2) Clone the SoftFloat 3a For Hercules repository 

    git clone https://github.com/hercules-390/SoftFloat-3a.git 

3) Run cmake to create build and installation control files

    cd x86                   #or whatever the install TLD is
    cd s3fh.release
    cmake ../../SoftFloat-3a

4) Run cmake  to build SoftFloat 3a For Hercules.  This corresponds to 
   a UNIX "make" command, and indeed, if you are building on UNIX, you
   could use make.  On Windows, you could use Visual Studio 2015 for
   this step.

    cmake --build . --clean-first --config Release

   Do not forget the dot in the above command.   "--clean-first" is
   not required on the first build, but will not cause problems.  

5) Run cmake to install SoftFloat 3a For Hercules.  This step copies 
   the library, public headers, and license documents into the 
   install directory tree, x86 in the example above.  This corresponds 
   to a UNIX "make install" command, and you can use that command if 
   you prefer.  There is no equivalent way to do this in Visual Studio
   2015.  

    cmake -P cmake_install.cmake 

At this point, SoftFloat 3a For Hercules has been built and you may
continue by building Hercules.  


PERFORM A DEBUG BUILD FROM SOURCE

Repeat steps 3, 4, and 5 as for a release build with the following 
changes.  A debug build creates the library SoftFloat_D.lib (Windows)
or libSoftFloat_D.a (non-Windows).  A Hyperion debug build will expect
the "_D" library.

3. Use directory s3fh.debug instead of s3fh.release

5. Use the following command to install the debug build. 

    cmake -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug -P cmake_install.cmake 
    
   If your host system is UNIX-based, you may omit -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug.
   See the Appendix below on the need for -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug.  


APPENDIX: DETAILS ON THE NEED FOR -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug

According to the legacy CMake bug tracker, build trees built for Visual
Studio or OS/X have multiple configurations included in a single tree,
and the install script needs the BUILD_TYPE passed to it from the
command line to install the correct configuration.  

See the following post to issue 11950 in that bug tracker.  Note that 
the bug under discussion is not related to Windows or OS/X.

APPENDIX: TECHNICAL NOTES ON THE BUILD

The tool chosen to build the package is CMAKE, and the CMakeLists.txt
file uses the name of the build directory to determine:

- the name of the install directory
- whether a release or debug build should be done.  

As follows:

To build a release configuration to be installed in the "soft"
directory, the build should take place in a directory named:

      soft.release

The build directory can be located anywhere, in any directory tree,
so long as you have read/write/execute permissions in the parent
directory.  

For a different naming convention or layout, use the following CMake
command in the build directory

cmake <path to source> -DINSTALL_PREFIX=<the install prefix>  \
                       -DBUILD_TYPE=<the build type>

<path to source> may be relative or absolute.
